		<p class="blog-content">Module 1 reflection:
			Module 1 at Turing was certainly an adventurous roller-coaster ride. It definitely felt like drinking from a firehose from day one. Nevertheless, saying that I 'learned a lot' would be an understatement. There are some amazing people in my cohort, and I learned something from each of them. I enjoyed interacting with my classmates, and there were some tears, laughs, and stresses along the way. I was glad to see others step up to support other students, both with technical concepts, as well as providing emotional support. Students going out of their way to share their knowledge and resources is my biggest takeaway from the module.</p>

			<p class="tech-topic">Version Control:
			I really enjoyed learning how to use Git, and Github. I think this will be a really useful skill moving forward working with other developers, and being on a team. Coming into Turing I had basic knowledge of how to use Github, but I definitely learned a lot of commands and tools during Module 1 at Turing.</p>
